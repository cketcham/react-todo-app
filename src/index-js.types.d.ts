// Derived from src/index.js

// Since the provided JavaScript file does not define any custom types, objects, or enums,
// and only imports and renders a React component, there are no specific types or enums to define here.
// The file primarily deals with rendering a React component, which is already typed by React's type definitions.

// However, if the `App` component or any other components imported in the future have specific props or state,
// those should be defined in their respective TypeScript files.

// Exporting an empty object to adhere to the instruction of exporting all types declared in this file.
